I've been in this rut for a year, and I hate how many people are in the same, if not a worse position. Don't kill yourself. All the things that made you happy in the past, that can still happen. It takes time and effort, and a lot of it, but believe me when I say its worth living. Its difficult to just get out of bed.

I felt like it was pointless, I didn't matter, I was never going to get better anyway, etc. For the first few sessions I answered with single words, \"\"I'm fine\"\", etc or just laid with my head in my arms on the table. It took me a long time, but I got to a point where I was participating in therapy and it definitely helped. Therapy is a long, slow process, but it has made a huge difference in my life. While talk therapy in general is good for getting things off your chest, CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) is what will help you the most. It's not so much a therapist just saying something that helps, but helping you restructure your thinking patterns and how you view yourself."

Sometimes life throws us into scenarios that don’t match where we think we “should” be. There are a lot of other young people also still living with family out there. It’s really really expensive to live independently these days, way worse than when our parents were our age. I have a reasonably good paying job for someone who never went to college but I live in a pretty expensive metropolitan area so when I move out I’ll still have to have roommates.

First, throw your sharp object away.  Sure you can find something else to cut with, but it will create a barrier so that you can’t do it as instantly.  Second, set an alarm for 10 minutes when you have the urge.  You could journal, listen to more uplifting music, or get some fresh air during that time.  Notice if your urge decreases or stays the same.  After that 10 minutes passes, you can then make your decision of what you want to do.  Lastly, use alternative less harmful ways to act on the urge.  Holding ice or snapping a rubber band on your skin can induce that same pain without bleeding or scarring.  I hope this helps!\""

It might be that depression has been attached to you for a long time, so thinking about yourself in a different way can feel very odd.  Practice envisioning a “life worth living” as they call it in therapy.  Create a list of values you see yourself having in the future if you were able to overcome your depression.  For example, mine are honesty, connection, authenticity, generosity, kindness, and open mindedness.  Hopefully this can help you see a different point of view on life and who you are.

   "title,response": "Waiting for bad things,\"Depression can often distort our logical senses, making us panic and feel depressed out of habit, when in reality there is nothing wrong . I remember that in psychology , they explained that the brain activates a sense of pleasure ,like having an addiction, out of being sad.  I have as well dealt with depression my whole life and this can often impact how we deal with our sadness, where at some degree we  become addicted without noticing/ unconsciously . After a long time we build a predisposition to see everything go wrong or bad, but to this you must rationalize and see the logistics  of the situation. I can understand that this may not be a quick process but try breathing exercises and think positively. Because at the end of the day you can go two ways, you can think negatively or positively and the path that can lead us to be more productive is staying in a positive note."

I also understand your frustration when it come to other folks not helping .  But unfortunately many folks do no go out of their way to help bystanders.  Again in psychology  is call the bystander effect. But try to not center your attention on others , since these are factors that are out of control.

Between that and watching how Avatar was made in short documentary youtube videos, which predicted animator as a job is a dying field since it will be replaced by computer programs who can make computer animation for them.

Once in a while, I would help other government officials move some boxes, send posts, and deliver confidential documents. But, mostly I played flash games on the work computers. When they later blocked it. I just started using proxy web services or https. The most serious thing I was most called for was IT or Translation, which wasn't a lot.

Eventually I managed to enter an university in US. Which was okay at first. Since, everything was metaphorically new and shiny to me. I went to a school psychologist my first year there. Who I convinced to see the school psychiatrist. Who told me he thought I am having depressive episodes but he didn't think I had depression yet on first few diagnosis. Eventually, I lost interest in education, so my grades slipped. Went from 3.8 on my first semester to failing academic standard by third semester. So, eventually school said come back when you feel like studying and academically dismissed me. I went to a community school after that, but for me, this was worse than my animation school in New Zealand. There were metal detectors, and clogged toilets everywhere. Literal shit school if you ask me. Anyway, I stopped attending there altogether too. I think I went to the community school a dozen times during that semester, and half of that was to hand in applications, before finally deciding education isn't right for me, at the end of that semester."

I kept getting told by a whole lot of people that maybe I didn't make the cut to be studying the major I chose, so I finally caved in and I tried changing that too. But, nope.

Since, you are not used to having clogged breathways any longer. Well, that's how I would describe my experience with the medication.

Parental approval can surely give you that boost of self confidence to move forward but sometimes that desire is misplaced. Unrealistic expectations can poison the well which is of no use to anyone. Take an honest assessment of where you were, are and where you want to be. Do things look reasonable?    Are you on a realistic path?  Are you a drug kingpin?  Pimp? Coyote?  If not then what/where are you?  Love what you do and who you are or else life will be dreary at best. Your age is important as well. The younger you are the more parental approval matters, on balance.

(His stance was always he didn't want to get married because his parents are miserable and refuse to divorce and it scarred him) But our love reached new heights when we shared a home together and he's not afraid anymore.

Each session are different topics and depending how i feel or if the psychiatrist see any improvements or not he chooses the dosis based on that. Also he gives personal tasks to do to improve your lifestyle. Ofc the tasks depending on how you feel are sometimes demanding, but is something that is gonna be useful on the longtime, not instantly.

You have got to realise that having social anxiety prevents you from doing things, it doesn't make them physically impossible, but to overcome the anxiety in a situation like that would take a lot of sacrifice and could have severe effects on your anxiety after that, so not being able to overcome your anxiety is not your fault, it was built into you and nothing could be done about it. If you had a 2 broken legs and were asked to run 100m, technically you could do it but realistically, you cant. You should see that a mental illness, such as social anxiety, is no different than a physical illness or injury, and you wouldn't blame yourself for not being able to run 100m with broken legs would you? So why should you for this situation. Also its not about the action that matters, its the thought, and you wanted to help, even though you may not have spoken out, which you couldn't of due to your situation, you wanted to and that's the best anyone could've done in your situation."

Also try and put anyone else in that situation, with the levels of social anxiety you had and also your verbal levels, no one could've done better than you did. People blame themselves for things happening all the time as they did not interfere, yet they fail to realise that interfering doesn't change the root of the problem and can actually make it worse sometimes, so don't blame yourself for not being able to speak, you yourself know there's nothing you could do about it, and that speaking wouldn't of changed your fathers acts.

Sometimes it's negative thought patterns. Sometimes it's a chemical imbalance in the brain. For me it was both of those things. But there are many other reasons as well. I suggest finding a therapist if you can. Visit different therapists until you find one that you like and trust. They can help you learn coping skills and new though processes as well as figure out what the root of the depression is. If it is a chemical imbalance, finding a psychiatrist to talk about medication with might also be helpful. Also, having friends or family members who are willing to be with you and help you figure out what's going on is helpful. I hope you find someone who can help you."

The aripiprazole is not sedating to me at all and definitely not like quetiapine. I took 50mg of quetiapine one night (25mg normally) and I was a zombie until about 1400 the next day. I have no idea how people take 600-800mg of it and get through their day. Be well.\""

Your desire to be with your loved ones is only natural, but they would never want you to hurt yourself. They love you and would want you to try to go on living until it is your time, naturally, to go home. You've got to make that first step and reach out to a Counselor that can help you deal with your feelings. There are people that care about you on this earth that would be so very sad if you weren't here anymore. I care, and I only know you from what you've written. I am also here if you want to talk.

I’m going through the same exact thing, more or less on some days. Essentially, you have to force yourself to feel something. But then you don’t believe that feeling is real because you’re “faking it” and it could just be a terrible rabbit hole from there. If you wanna talk, you can PM me! For one thing, I suggest doing one thing that you remember gives you at least some sort of temporary excitement or happiness. Of course, I wouldn’t suggest anything unhealthy, like drugs etc. And I’m sure you’ve heard this a thousand times but exercise helps. Talking to someone who would listen/understand helps too. Anyway, sorry for the rambling, I just spewed a bunch of possibly useless stuff from the top of my head, but I hope you reach out to someone and can get help and start getting better (and obviously get completely better) and find true happiness and contentment, as well as be able to feel true emotions again.

Throughout high school I did have depression and anxiety but I didn't know I had it, therefore throughout high school I had poor grades, poor enough that I actually ended up graduating with a 1.7 gpa and no awards, no recognitions, no nothing, and then I failed my first year of college. Throughout this entire time my family as well was disappointed in me, I was quite literally a loser, bad grades, no friends, no SO, nothing. it wasn't until I was 18 that I met people I could really call friends, which is honestly all I had for a while. I had a SO during my first year of college, and because she made me happy, I feared my depression would return so I fear her leaving every day, then I find out I'm moving to another state, which them meant id either have to make long distance work or end the relationship, then came the news that I was failing my classes, and soon after my gf and I broke up for other reasons, ironically that day I was going to tell her I was moving, but I was shook by the breakup that nothing else came to mind, my final grades came in and I failed three of five classes, so here I am hanging on by a strand, with nothing left. I decided that now that I had nothing, I was going to use this move to make something out of myself, so I picked up new habits, got rid of old habits, and those friends I met at 18 years old, we're all still really close even after I moved, they still talk to me and some have even come visit me, them my grades made a huge improvement when I started at the new school, and now I'm a year away from graduating college with a 3.0 gpa. I understand that things are hard for you right now, but if I, some kid from nowhere who was the definition of a loser, could turn his life around, I believe anyone can, after all, we are still alive so theres still time to turn things around\""

I think I can take on a lot of classes after a small break and then I get stressed and sometimes end up crying at times. But with this situation its not really over nothing, form my experience the reason we feel so sad that we break down is because of being overwhelmed. And from my experience being overwhelmed isn't just caused by too much work, it could be caused by a new experience that we didn't or did foresee but we have to go through. Ive moved from place to place for most of my life so I've been overwhelmed from getting back into the rhythm of things and new experiences multiple times, the way I cope is to look at it as a new opportunity, typically no one knows me when these experiences arise, so I see it as an opportunity to make a better version of myself, no one knows me therefore I can change a few habits that I'm not fond of. So I recommend you try and look at this as a way to get rid of old habits or create new habits that you've wanted to make for yourself\""

Let's say your greatest fear is true: Let's say you're a really mean and angry abuser. It's up to her to read you and make the decision of wanting you in her life, not yours. Depending on how fresh both of you are from previous relationships, things may vary and the process of breaking up and falling in love leads to us having our personality shaped by the ones who we have feelings for. Who knows? Maybe you are really an abuser, but as you grow as a person next to somebody as heavenly as that woman you're describing, maybe you'll be surprised and turn into a kinder person. Love can be as destructive as it can be a beautiful thing\""

I’m no expert so I’m just speaking from my experience. I was in denial about being depressed and drank the sorrows away a lot. I had friends who did what you’re doing and only until I accepted my issues is when i could see what they were doing was helpful.

Detachment is a common symptom of depression, and from the sound of things my theory is that you are functional, but at the cost of being distant, like your mind sees the benefits and costs of certain things subconsciously, it sounds absurd I know but not unlikely if I'm being honest. I as well actually have problems with being able to express myself clearly, which is bad cause I'm a business major so I'm doing my best to help this problem and trying to help others as well along the way. And you are heading in the right direction by asking those around you (like your significant other) but something we gotta keeping mind is that they want to help us, they really do, but they aren't therapists. And actually thats what therapy is for, so that you can talk as unclear as you want because that might just be a clue to finding a solution for your mental illness, I go to therapy and I literally just unravel there, I tell them the full story because I want to solve my mental illness problem, and the only way for that to happen is if both the doctor and the patient know the full story so that we can get to the source and solve the problem, and from there its just a matter of keeping up with things the therapist tells you and with time things will get better, because we haven't given up since we're still here in the world, we're still getting back up after a hit of life so we aren't down for the count, and we aren't alone, I guarantee theres many more like us out there, part of the reason why this subreddit was made in the first place\""

With that said, it does sound like they're using a strengths based model which for some people would work. However, a good therapist should know that their guiding theory won't work with every client and they should either a)try something different or b) refer you elsewhere. It doesn't surprise me that they both use the same method if they're out of the same clinic. Personally, for PTSD I have heard EMDR is amazing (you can check out some of the research) and my preferred theory is CBT because of how structured it can be.

I’m speaking from experience because I have anxiety and all of my psychologists I’ve been to have been strongly against cannabis use as someone with a mental illness. It all depends on what type of mental illness you have. Maybe CBD can help, I wouldn’t know because I no longer choose to partake in ever trying drugs again. I’d rather deal with anxiety on my own than rely on taking a drug everytime I freak out. My sister’s husband has slight anxiety when going out in public and takes CBD lol and he’s fine.

He won't have **any** incentive to change if you continue to let the cycle take place."

They’re sorry, the apologize. They promise to do it again. Gradually tension amps up and he snaps. Abuse isn’t always physical, although once it becomes this you increasingly are at risk of more serious injury or even death. Abuse can be coercive control like limiting who you see, where you go, what you wear, and how you feel about yourself.

If you have any friends who see a therapist you could use them as a referral. Often therapists' schedules will fluctuate whether or not they are taking new clients so it can be tricky. If the therapist is part of a clinic they may refer to another therapist in house. This method may open doors that would otherwise be closed. The only consideration is if the referring friend is a pivotal figure in your life. If so the therapist may consider it a conflict of interest and refer (hopefully) in house to another therapist."

Your partner texts to hang out instead but you tell them \"\"I have plans with Jimmy, but I'm free tomorrow at 6!\"\" Partner replies saying, \"\"that's really selfish of you, I really just want to spend time with you and you're not here for me,\"\" but doesn't have a legitimate reason (no death in the family, they're not ill, etc) for you choosing to hang out with partner over your friend who you have had plans with for 2 weeks. You choose to hang out with your friend because you promised yourself you wouldn't cancel your plans. At dinner, you mention that your partner got upset when you chose to hang out with Jimmy instead of partner. How does Jimmy react? He may say, \"\"what a load of hoseshit, throwawayyy1456, partner has no reason to be upset, we've had these plans for 2 weeks!\"\" Then you have some confirmation that this is a red flag alert and can open the conversation with your partner about how their behavior crossed a boundary for you."

From what you’ve said, you didn’t get to spend a lot of time as a child/adolescent getting to know who you are. You have always been working and taking on very grown up roles. I’m also hearing a lot of internalized pressure. It sounds as though you believe every time you make it over the *next* hurdle you will find happiness. It doesn’t sound like you have a balanced life. Think of your life like slices of a pie, with equal amounts of energy going to each slice. You need slices for work, friendship, love, spirituality, hobbies. Spend some time getting to know who you are outside of work and academics. Figure out what is fun to you. Start talking back to these negative voices in your head. This is where therapy can truly help. It may also help in addressing some of the childhood experiences that are likely the root of those negative messages. Do better with self-care, including adding some pleasure in your life. Good luck to you!\",Thank you so much for the advice.

In other words, if you’re in the middle of a divorce, you just moved to a new town where you know no one and your cat just died money isn’t likely to help much. If your life is simply about money and the job that brings it doesn’t bring you joy, then what is the point?

Honestly this is your decision nobody can make it for you and its not something you can take in to consideration lightly. Do what you think is right.

Having gone through this an a similar situation, you need to learn to let go after a while. An emotionally abusive mother is just that, and while it is absolutely heartbreaking to have to witness, there really isn't much that you can do. You cant fix the other parent, and chances are you cant fix the situatuon because it is very, very hard to prove. The mother is unavailable because the child is her source of validation. Is it awful? Yes. Can you prove it? Doubtful. Will the child be okay? Probably."

It does feel like they aren't attached to my body.  I have had that happen for years and I'm still here and for the most part sane. I think it's called depersonalization.  I also at times feel spaced out like I'm not here and I'm just observing from above. Your sense of smell gets extremely sensitive when your highly anxious, it's a primitive reaction from when we actually had to worry about predators.

Every so often she would ask if I had Googled his name. I hadn’t because it was irrelevant regarding therapy but we did explore her need to be recognized and valued for having a “famous” boyfriend. So therapy finally ended and some years went by and one day I was Googling something and the thought popped up regarding my former clients boyfriend. I remembered his name and Googled it.

Are simply a Reflection of the chaotic insane beautiful impossible to comprehend reality of this demention of existence. Now the most essential Base rule of life is the first law of thermodynamics. Nothing can be destroyed only changed. Things fall apart and then they come together again. This is the endless beautiful cycle of the universe that we get to be apart of. It's literally impossible for your life to be extinguished. You will not end you will be transformed. You have been so many other things before you were you and you have faced death an endless amount of times and you will continue to endlessly until the universe itself collapses and is destroyed and eventually transformed anew. Repeating the cycle again. I understand how scary it can be. We have all felt that unimaginable feeling of horror at some point in our lives. That deep indescribable fear that pierces your soul. The idea that that feeling could be waiting for us after death is horrifying but that just wouldnt make any sense at all. Existence isn't vindictive or cruel. If it was life itself wouldn't function. No matter what your state of existence there will be good and bad. Same as your life now.

If you do nothing the gaps in social skills and executive functioning will just grow and become more permanent.

There are some who only struggle with it situationally or exhibit symptoms of it during an adjustment disorder but many will tell you its lifelong for them. Of course it can and will get better and treatment will depend on the therapist and the client. In my opinion I would work to build/teach coping mechanisms for my clients that they will be able to use consistently and regularily. Im not sure that traveling is something that can be done regularily enough to help. This can vary on the client. If my client has a passion for traveling it may be time to explore a career change or hobby or something like that, but I am not there to advice them to GO traveling. I am not there to give any advice, really.  I am there to help them explore what about traveling is so good for them and how to find that in other aspects of life. Is my client practicing enough self care? How do they cope with stress? Others may disagree with me, but that is how I would approach your question. Counseling is based on the wellness model, where psychiatry is more on the medical based model so I would personally refrain from saying I \"\"prescribed\"\" anything.

So he might be irritated in general by his partner because she literally embodies the shameful part of sex.

Perhaps his way of processing his initial shame and other cultural baggage around it is to feel ridiculously turned on by it (and possibly to ask for additional pleasure and pain dynamics to be introduced, such as having his partner restrain him so that he can't resist this \"\"shameful\"\" act, spankings and other S&M type punishment).

He would be carrying around all this shame, and his perception of his female partners (already shaded by ancient Greek attitudes towards women) would be to consider their role in sex shameful (so far that's in line with your Madonna/Whore theory). So he might be irritated in general by his partner because she literally embodies the shameful part of sex. BUT, *people who have a deep seated shame surrounding sex often process that into a kink.* It's possible that your main character could develop a fetish for oral sex. Perhaps his way of processing his initial shame and other cultural baggage around it is to feel ridiculously turned on by it (and possibly to ask for additional pleasure and pain dynamics to be introduced, such as having his partner restrain him so that he can't resist this \"\"shameful\"\" act, spankings and other S&M type punishment).

You've been tremendously helpful, I really can't thank you enough. I think in my character's case, the beating happens when the character is caught in the act, and is severe enough to require medical attention---the fact that his mentor didn't protect him and abandoned him after combined with the extreme boundary violation of his father interrupting such a sexually charged event with overkill brutality would, I think, create a profound break in his ability to love himself and trust others.

A lot of the time it is essentially  marriage & couples counseling that may or may not focus on sexual dysfunction (one of the main causes of relationships failing is because of some type of sexual dysfunction, ie ED, vaginismus, etc). There are some clinicians who do specialize (ex, BDSM community) and work with specific and unique issues that are typically present in different relationship types. I am going to likely pursue getting that certification via AASECT (American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors, and Therapists) once I am done with my residency for licensure. The AASECT website has a ton of info/resources. Also they have a yearly conference which is super interesting."

If someone decides they don't care when feelings are honestly - (and compassionately) - expressed then I don't think there's anything you can do about that, you just have to accept they have their own issues and leave it at that. One way I've found helpful with people who lack empathy is to empathise with their position - why do they behave coldly? Out of what intentions are they acting? Are they just struggling like the rest of us? Don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting you put their struggles above your own, but I've found personally that empathising with those who hurt me has made it easier for me to walk away without holding on to anger and continuing to let the situation hurt me.\""

My biggest advice to you is you have to view the classes less as grades to get or credits to complete and more as learning opportunities.  The thing that helped me most is beginning to enjoy the classes that I took. I had 2 AP’s, English and physics, and once I learned to really enjoy them I ended up getting A’s. I’m generally a pretty lazy person who procrastinated a lot, but if you enjoy the classes managing work load is much easier. Another big tip is make sure to sleep enough, your sleep schedule can make or break how you feel throughout the day. Best of luck to you!\""

After some tests, turned out it was from the lexapro being too high, she was already on pretty minimal doses. I have no idea how they came to this conclusion, I think it was more of let's try this and see if it decreases, in combination with some ointments.  If you take any drugs, look to them as well. It simply could also be in your head. I was on vacation with my family  a week ago and developed stress hives. Since I've been back home (I don't live with them), my mood has improved significantly and I feel amazing! I haven't gotten any new hives and the ones I have are tapering out.

Try keeping notes (I like to use the Google Keep app) of the date, time, and what you were doing when you reach your threshold. Do this for a few weeks to a month, or as long as you want. It will help you identify patterns of times and situations where you tend to reach that threshold and then you can come up with some modifications. For example, I get really overstimulated at the grocery store so now my husband goes. I get overstimulated at work when it's loud from everyone talking and the phones constantly ringing, so I always keep my headphones in my pocket and I'll skip away to the bathroom to get a few minutes of quiet time."

Distractions help and the more stuff done during the day benefits the evening 'feelings'. The optimal is when the body is as equally tired as the mind. That's where excercise helps. I have now been trying to learn to relax more and so far it has been somewhat successful. Not that the symptoms have passed but at least alleviated.

If you’re worried about applications and college stuff, then get a jump on it and start filling things out now so it won’t seem so overwhelming in a few months. Take bite size pieces as opposed to looking at the whole pie. Which leads me to your binge eating issue. You might have more complicated anxiety than just your run of the mill stress related kind. Consider chatting with a therapist or doctor about it all. You could use a mild anti-depressant or anti anxiety med to help you cope. That you acknowledge and realize what is happening with you is HUGE!!!! Now if only you can do that as something is happening so you can adjust your behavior. Do what you can. Make a list. Check items off the list. Make achievable goals. And stop being so damn hard on yourself! Take a walk. Play Pokémon go! Visit a new place in your town.

Because like the video says it's hard to talk about these problems due to their innate nature, and so maybe a guide suggesting how one contacts a mental health professional (let's say on campus) could be more useful and more direct. Maybe talk about confidentiality and stuff. It'd be great if society talked about physical and mental health equally but what about the people suffering right now.\",\"Hi silnt, thank you for sharing your thoughts and suggestions. I also agree with you that there needs to be someone who can provide a guide on how resources can be reached and utilized. The teams at Wish I Knew will reflect on this advice and explore for ways to work more effectively to provide more practical help to people. \""

Kindness in that she is just trying her best even if it doesn't seem like it.  There's goodness in everyone , sometimes you just have to look harder for it.

Taking paracetamol or Aleve helps. It just gives you some relief until it wears off. So I only take it once or twice a day. Neck and shoulder pain from stress is very common as well. You definitely need to get a massage or do some exercises to help you. A lot of people “hold” their stress in the shoulders and then this creates neck muscle pain and consequently headaches. I say it feels like a hot poker in my left temple. It eventually does go away. However, you do have to do some work and figure out what helps you relax... meditate. Yoga. Herbal tea. Stretching exercises. Massage. Removing yourself from the stress factor. Btw, an aside, allergies can cause sinus issues which can cause headaches too. Worth checking out. If you have a headache, you get stressed, and get shoulder and neck pain too. I’ve had both scenarios. But more likely it’s just good old shitty stress. Hope you feel better soon."

I think instead of trying to complete all the readings one by one, it is more efficient to study smart such as extracting the key concepts from the readings based on the materials taught in class or read more on what you're unclear on and what the professor put emphasis on..etc. It is definitely overwhelming to try to do all the readings from all courses, and, most likely, you will not be able to do that and will just end up over-stressing yourself. It is very important to know how to study smart, and it starts by communicating with your professors and TAs! \""

My advice to you is to purposefully eat. So get a food journal or use the note app on your phone and log when you have to eat. Just start small and eating healthy usually helps. Eating more nutritious and fiber rich food will keep you fuller longer and is just more healthy.

I took the minimum number of credit hours required to be a full-time student during my junior and senior year and took the rest of the required classes during the summer (sure, the classes are more expensive, but you can take most core classes during the summer at a community college for less cost). You get less of a break, but it helped me stay in a school mindset while not being overwhelmed by assignments.

If you need a different prescribed medication, you can oftentimes call your doctors' office and they can write you a different prescription after you speak to a nurse on the phone and they discuss with your MD, thus preventing a visit and copay. There's no reason you can't call them and say \"\"you prescribed me X medication for Y diagnosis, but it isn't working for A, B, and C reasons. Can you change me to something else\"\"? I work at a hospital and people do this all the time. \",\"I can't say for sure if its just stress but I only throw up during the week, when I attended classes.

From what I’ve been told, I believe it can - if you are under a great deal of stress. I think it is because when you are stressed your body is in a bit of a panic, like a fight or flight response. That response is meant for short term responses to danger and then for your stress hormones and blood flow to return to normal when the situation has passed. Being in a constant state of stress never lets your body go back to it’s more normal relaxed state.  I’m trying to remember all my neurologist had said about it one time. I think he mentioned something about your blood flow in your brain is different because your body is focusing on the things it needs immediately to be safe, and memory and cognition aren’t as important in that moment. So long term stress can impact your retrieval of memories among other things. Not permanent at all. It’s really important to give yourself even just like fifteen minutes to sit and relax. Do breathing exercises. There’s little things you can do to help your body and brain relax. Now that all being said remember the part about me not being a doctor. You don’t want to self diagnose your own brain. You and I don’t know enough about what’s going on in there. Please go see your doctor and let them know what is going on. It could be stress but it also could be a number of other things. For me it was a medication I had been taking coupled with the stress. But no amount of relaxing or breathing exercises was going to help unless I also got off that medication. What helps me when I’m stressed is to have a plan of action. I’d put fifteen minutes of relaxation as well as a doctor appt on yours in addition to anything else you think will help relieve some stress. Please take care! Hope things look up for you soon.\""

Try putting on some soothing music without words (I recommend classical), stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and touch your toes. Really stay there, for at least 30 seconds (I recommend a minute, it feels longer than it is!), and as you breathe focus on areas that your body is holding stress (mine is in the shoulders and neck). Bring your breath to the area, and as you exhale sink deeper into the stretch. Shift to one leg and hold it, then shift to the other, before going back to the middle for a final centering.

I'd love to learn how to stop this nasty habit once and for all\",\"I've actually stopped biting them off, but often nibble on them, teeth under them, etc. But through mindfulness practice (meditation, journaling about causes of my stresses, anxieties, panic attacks , etc) I've created a little time-gap, thankfully enough to become aware that me biting my nails is a result of my anxiety, instead of biting them down to the skin for a long time like before. I also read Charles Duhigg's The Power of Habit, which states that most addictions/habits follow a cycle of cue (stress/anxious) -> routine (biting nails) -> reward (stress relief). Once again, I don't know WHY it relieves stress, and I still don't understand it, but understanding this cycle made allowed me to mentally sectionalize each part of the cycle, and replace the routine with some other forms of stress relief, such as ASMR like my favorite song(s), a brief walk, stretching, deep breath exercises, visualizing my future, goals, etc. or a stress ball. So, once again, I still get the cue to bite them since I did it for a while, but as soon as my fingers touch my lips, I become aware of what I am doing and why, and take a different course of action.
